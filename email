Subject: Recap of AI Friday Event

Hi [Senior’s Name],

Just wanted to give you a quick update on what happened during the AI Friday event last week:

Practice Sessions (Mon–Thu): We spent the first four days in the AI Lab getting hands-on practice with the setup. Attendance wasn’t required for the whole day – we only needed to be there when the team wanted to collaborate or needed our presence. They provided systems with open network access and Azure-hosted LLM API keys to get us ready for the contest.

Contest Day (Friday):

The event started at 1:30 PM and ran till 8:00 PM.

From 1:30 to 6:30 PM, each team worked on a different task to build an Agentic AI framework.

At 7 PM, we presented our solutions to a panel of jury members.

Participants could join as a team or register individually (teams of 5 were formed). We had 3 teams at our location, each with a unique challenge.

Rewards: Everyone got an AI Friday T-shirt, and the winning team received 1000 gems per member.

Overall, it was a well-organized and engaging event that gave us good hands-on experience and a chance to collaborate with others.

Best,
[Your Name]
